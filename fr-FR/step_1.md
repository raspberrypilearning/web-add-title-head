The `<title>` tag is shown in the title bar of your web browser and should be relevant to your page. For example `Awesome jokes about dinosaurs`.

The `<title>` can be found in the `<head>` element at the top of your `index.html` file:

## --- code ---

language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 9
-------------------------------------------------------

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />

```
  <!-- Title shown in web browsers-->
  <title>My website title</title>
```

\--- /code ---

**Tip:** Now that your title has been updated you can collapse the <head>. Collapsing parts of the code you don't need to focus on helps to make your code easier to read.

Click on the small triangle next to line 3 to collapse the <head>. If you need to add fonts or change the title later you can expand it again when you need to.
