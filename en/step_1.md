The `<title>` tag is shown in the title bar of your web browser and should be relevant to your page. An example of a `<title>` tag is `Awesome jokes about dinosaurs`.
  
You can find the `<title>` in the `<head>` element at the top of your `index.html` file.

      <!-- Title shown in web browsers-->

**Tip:** Now that you have updated your title, you can collapse the `<head>`. You can collapse parts of the code that you don't need to focus on to make your code easier to read.  

Click on the small triangle next to line 3 to collapse the `<head>`. If you need to add fonts or change the title later, you can expand it again when you need to.
